This project aims to develop a system for enabling hand gestures in a remote collaboration scenario, with a special focus on architectural design and using architectural paper plans.

This prototype consists of two twin tabletop systems with a depth camera and a projector attached to them. The system uses the depth camera (Intel RealSense) together with Computer Vision algorithms to recognise and capture hand gestures, transmits those gestures to the other twin system, and then projects those hand gestures on the other end table, augmenting the physical space. However, the scope of the current system is quite limited, as it only detects, logs, transmit and displays a number of hand gestures to the other end, and vice versa.
